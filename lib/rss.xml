 <br>A digital garden is a personal, open, and evolving collection of notes, ideas, and resources shared on the internet, typically in a non-linear format. Unlike traditional blogs or websites that emphasize polished, finished content, a digital garden is more focused on the growth of knowledge over time, allowing for updates, revisions, and exploration of thoughts in various stages of development.<br>Blog post: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://dev.to/jbranchaud/the-digital-garden-l10" target="_blank">https://dev.to/jbranchaud/the-digital-garden-l10</a>]]></description><link>https://rydra.github.io/til/concepts/digital-garden.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">TIL/concepts/Digital Garden.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rydra]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 13:56:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Learn in Public]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>"Learning in public" refers to the practice of sharing your learning journey, progress, and even mistakes openly, often through blog posts, social media, videos, or other platforms. The idea is to publicly document what you're learning, whether it's a new skill, a subject, or a project, while engaging with a broader community.<br>This approach has several benefits:<br>
<br>Accountability: By sharing your progress, you're more likely to stick with your goals.
<br>Feedback: You can receive helpful feedback and advice from others, often accelerating your learning process.
<br>Building a reputation: It helps build your personal brand as someone who is curious, consistent, and willing to share knowledge.
<br>Helping others: Your experiences, challenges, and solutions can be valuable for others going through similar learning processes.
<br>For example, someone learning a new programming language might write regular blog posts about what they’ve learned, or post code snippets and discuss challenges and breakthroughs on GitHub or Twitter.<br>References:<br>

 <br>I learnt to export my ObsidianMD vault as HTML and publish it on Github Pages. Tried Jekyll first, wasn't quite what I was looking for, so I used the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export" target="_blank">Obsidian Webpage Export</a>. Unfortunately the documentation link wasn't working, so I made it work by intuition, but at least I have now my personal digital garden where I can share what I learn as a software engineer.<br>Very immature for now, but hopefully the beginning of something greater. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://rydra.github.io" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://rydra.github.io" target="_blank">Check out my garden!</a>]]></description><link>https://rydra.github.io/til/obsidian/exporting-vault-to-html-and-publish-it.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">TIL/obsidian/Exporting vault to HTML and publish it.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rydra]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 14:02:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Slides in Obsidian]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Improving retention while studying requires techniques that engage your brain actively and help you process and store information more effectively. Here are some strategies to help you retain information better, regardless of the topic:<br><br>
<br>What it is: Actively trying to recall information from memory rather than passively reviewing notes.
<br>How to apply: After studying a topic, close your notes and try to write down or say out loud what you remember. This strengthens the neural connections related to that knowledge.
<br>Why it works: It forces your brain to retrieve information, which improves long-term retention. Studies show that testing yourself is more effective than simply re-reading notes.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: A learning technique where you review material at gradually increasing intervals.
<br>How to apply: Use a tool like Anki or Quizlet, which are designed for spaced repetition, or create your own system by scheduling reviews—after one day, then two days, then a week, etc.
<br>Why it works: The brain retains information better when it's revisited over time, as opposed to cramming all at once.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: Instead of focusing on one subject or type of problem at a time (blocked practice), interleaving involves mixing different topics or problem types during study sessions.
<br>How to apply: When studying multiple subjects, alternate between them rather than studying one topic in-depth before moving on to the next. For example, if you're learning math, mix algebra, calculus, and geometry problems.
<br>Why it works: Interleaving helps you learn to distinguish between concepts and apply the right method for each problem, which enhances understanding and retention.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: Explaining concepts in your own words, adding detail, and connecting new ideas to things you already know.
<br>How to apply: After learning a new concept, try explaining it out loud as if you were teaching it to someone else. Also, connect it to related ideas or examples from your experience.
<br>Why it works: It forces deeper processing of the material, helping you understand it more thoroughly, making it easier to remember.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: Turning abstract concepts into visual representations (like diagrams, mindmaps, or flowcharts).
<br>How to apply: When studying a topic, create diagrams or draw visual summaries to represent key ideas. Use mindmaps to show relationships between concepts.
<br>Why it works: Visuals help you engage both verbal and spatial memory systems, reinforcing retention and aiding understanding.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: A method of learning where you try to explain a concept as simply as possible, as if you were teaching it to a child.
<br>How to apply: Write down what you’re trying to learn and explain it in the simplest terms. If you struggle, go back and identify gaps in your understanding, then study that part again and repeat the process.
<br>Why it works: Teaching forces you to clarify your understanding and expose areas where you need more review.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: Breaking down complex information into smaller, manageable pieces or "chunks."
<br>How to apply: Organize information into smaller groups or categories (e.g., when memorizing long lists, group related items together).
<br>Why it works: The brain can only handle so much information at once. Chunking reduces cognitive load and makes it easier to remember larger amounts of data.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: Combining verbal and visual information to enhance understanding and retention.
<br>How to apply: Pair your notes with diagrams, illustrations, or graphs. When reading text, try sketching a picture to represent key ideas, or create a mental image of what you're studying.
<br>Why it works: The brain processes visual and verbal information differently, so using both forms strengthens your ability to remember the material.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: Memory aids that help you retain information by associating it with something more memorable (acronyms, rhymes, associations).
<br>How to apply: Create acronyms for lists, use rhymes for sequences, or make up stories that connect different pieces of information.
<br>Why it works: Mnemonics take advantage of your brain’s ability to remember vivid, unusual, or personal things more easily than abstract information.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: Explaining how and why certain concepts or processes work, to yourself, as you study.
<br>How to apply: As you read or solve problems, continuously ask yourself "Why does this work?" or "How does this connect to what I already know?" and then explain it.
<br>Why it works: This active engagement deepens your understanding and makes it easier to recall the material later.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: Condensing large amounts of information into concise summaries.
<br>How to apply: After studying a chapter or topic, write a brief summary in your own words, focusing on the key points.
<br>Why it works: Summarization forces you to extract the most important ideas, which reinforces your grasp of the material.

<br>What it is: A time management technique that divides study time into intervals (usually 25 minutes of focused work followed by a short break).
<br>How to apply: Set a timer for 25 minutes, study intensely, and then take a 5-minute break. After four sessions, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
<br>Why it works: This technique helps maintain focus and prevents burnout, which is essential for long-term retention. Breaks also help consolidate information.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: Explaining what you've learned to someone else.
<br>How to apply: Teach the material to a peer, or even pretend to teach it to an imaginary audience. You can use real-world examples to make it more understandable.
<br>Why it works: Teaching forces you to fully understand the material, and it often exposes gaps in your knowledge.
<br><br>
<br>What it is: Prioritizing sleep, as the brain consolidates memories and processes information during sleep.
<br>How to apply: Ensure you get enough sleep, especially after learning something new. Avoid cramming all night.
<br>Why it works: Sleep improves memory retention and enhances the brain’s ability to integrate new information.
<br><br>A combination of active learning techniques, such as active recall, spaced repetition, and self-explanation, along with techniques that enhance your mental engagement, like dual coding and visualization, will significantly boost your retention. Regular review and proper rest are also essential for long-term retention. <br>What combination of techniques do you think might work best for your study habits?<br><a href="https://rydra.github.io?query=tag:flashcards/study" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#flashcards/study</a><br><br>The technique to explain a topic you just studied to someone like he is a child is called Feynman technique<br><br>It is important to sleep to consolidate knowledge, memories and processes<br><br>Mention some visualization techniques you can use to improve retention<br>

<br>What is the term used to define memory aids that help you remember information?::nmemonics. Lists of acronyms (e.g. SOLID), etc, rhymes or made up stories<br><br>How is it called the process of dividing a topic into smaller parts for easier assimilation?::chunking. The brain can only handle so much information at once. Chunking reduces cognitive load and makes it easier to remember larger amounts of data<br>]]></description><link>https://rydra.github.io/learning/techniques.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Learning/Techniques.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rydra]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 12:23:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tips and tricks]]></title><description><![CDATA[
