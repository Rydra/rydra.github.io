Unlike traditional blogs or websites that emphasize polished, finished content, a digital garden is more focused on the growth of knowledge over time, allowing for updates, revisions, and exploration of thoughts in various stages of development.\nBlog post: dev.to/jbranchaud/the-digital-garden-l10"},"index":{"title":"Welcome to Quartz","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Hey ho! Welcome to my digital garden. I’m David Jiménez, Senior software engineer currently working @ Scopely Games. Restless and curious, I’ve worked +10 years as developer and architect across a variety of fields, ranging from industries like insurance, digital marketing, pharma, social networks and now videogames. But, above everything else, I am mostly a problem solver who thinks and tries to fit the best solution to the problem at hand instead of always using the same tool over and over again.\nThis garden is the place where I store all the knowledge I’m acquiring as time goes by, in an effort to follow the Learning in Public philosophy where I can improve my learning method by sharing what I know with everybody else. I hope by reading my notes you feel comfortable.\nSome places where you can get in touch with me:\n\nGithub\nLinkedIn\nDEV.to where I share my thoughts on technical posts\n"}}
