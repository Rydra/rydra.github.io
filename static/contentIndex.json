In fact, the ship’s sensors detected a clean atmosphere rich in oxygen and a mild temperature, so I could safely leave it without my space helmet.\nTo my surprise, the atmosphere smells like fresh mint. Charmed by it, I started walking, in hopes of finding the source of such scent. I literally lost the sense of time in such a way that it immediately became deep night. Looking at the sky, I could appreciate the three moons at work: they all reflected the light of the sun, casting a moonbeam that illuminated the surface of the planet with a gentle blue-ish green environment that made me feel cozy and warm.\nDrugged by this whirlwind of sensations, I stumbled upon the source of the mint scent to my surprise: a giant, thick flower with a purple blossom. It was majestic. I spent a minute to smell the flower up close as if I wanted to take some of that scent during the rest of my journey in this planet.\nI took a proper photo, collected some samples and moved on to my next target.\nAbandoning the lush greenery of the fields, I headed north with my portable plane till I came across what seemed a cave formation.\nCurious, I entered and started to descend into the endless darkness. The more I delved into it, the colder it was getting up to the point of freezing. It was getting so cold I had to put my special suit for harsh climates. What a change of pace compared to the previous greenery I was welcomed before this!\nAmidst the darkness though I saw a spark of light in a wall which grabbed my attention. Curious, I grabbed a pickaxe (it was a difficult endeavor to grab it with my thick gloves) and started digging.\nAt a point, the wall collapsed, and I quickly stepped back before I would be swallowed by the rocks. The effort has been worthwhile though: I’ve found a chamber made of ice and crystals. A tiny beam of light from a hole entered the place, but the walls of the chamber were as polished and smooth as mirrors, which reflected and bounced the light on all directions, creating a light you would never believe you would find so deep in the earth.\nAstonishing is not a word I would use to describe this.\nBut that room was not the only surprised that awaited me. A rapidly moving shadow passed by the room. At first I thought that my eyes were deceiving me because I was just dazed and blinded by a reflected light beam, but after a second look it was clear that I was not dreaming.\nThere it was, some kind of avian creature, with a sharp beak with fur instead of feathers. It was not like those birds called “penguins” my Earth biology book talked about. It was more like a blue phoenix, with a long, beautiful tail consisting of three appendices.\nI tried calling it using my bird whistle to have a closer look upon it. Unfortunately no response. It got scared and flew off. What a missed opportunity…"},"Gaming-and-boardgames/Alone-among-the-stars/Planet-Sulfura":{"title":"Planet Sulfura","links":[],"tags":["boardgames","log"],"content":"As I abandoned the ship’s pod after landing, I started investigating a field with grass as tall as the biggest of the trees on earth. It felt as a labyrinth. Suddenly, I tripped and when I raised my head, there it was: a blue fox with two tails which playfully was jumping side by side surrounding me. It was beautiful, charming and eerie. He looked harmless, so I stood up, petted it, gave it a small chunk of my multi-nutrient buns, and kept moving.\nAfter I left the tall grass forest, I bumped into a cascade of purple water. It was relaxing and the white noise generated by the splashing water made me fall sleep by accident, resting my head on top of my traveling backpack.\nThen I heard a noise, like a violent splash which suddenly woke me up. Curious I get close to the water, and I saw a green glow which grabbed my attention.\nMy curiosity got the best of me, equipped my scuba diving suit, and then jumped into the purple waters, below the cascade. And what a surprise, it was a glowing crab. I took some photos of it, surprised by the discovery.\nAfter the crab, I noticed in the dark area a small underwater cave. Something was definitely moving, so I took my time to check that cave.\nThe cave was small, and dark. And then I felt like something grabbed my feet, making me unable to move. I got entangled into some kind of weed. It startled me and I was scared.\nQuickly I picked up my knife and cut it, though it was an arduous labor. The weed seemed to regrow quickly as I cut it, much like the head of an hydra. Through persistence I managed to escape, but shush, that was scary.\nAfter the diving adventure I continued walking, towards a Volcano. The purple color of the water and distinctive glow of the wildlife is most likely due to the high concentration of sulfur in this planet, so to gather some more knowledge it makes sense to go and investigate the volcanoes of the area.\nDuring the climb, I stopped for a second for a short snack, sitting on a rock. However, I was completely oblivious to the fact that the rock had some inscription in an alien language, and it held some kind of special shape, like a perfectly cut, squared diamond shape. It resembles some kind of altar. Maybe it was culturally bound to the volcano for the former inhabitants of the planet, as some kind of ritual?"},"Gaming-and-boardgames/RPG-sessions/Starforged-mindmap":{"title":"Starforged mindmap","links":[],"tags":["role"],"content":""},"Gaming-and-boardgames/Useful-oracles-for-TTRPG":{"title":"Useful oracles for TTRPG","links":[],"tags":["boardgames"],"content":"\nJuice\nOne page Solo Engine (it has a companion Android app)\n"},"Gaming-and-boardgames/Videogame-roadmap-for-children":{"title":"Videogame roadmap for children","links":[],"tags":["videogames"],"content":"Videojuegos por edades\nLa edad adecuada para introducir a tu hijo a los videojuegos depende de su desarrollo y del tipo de juegos que elijas.

The infrastructure architecture is pretty simple:\n\nThe services are deployed in docker containers\nThe services are exposed through Traefik\n\nAs an exercise I decided to move all those services to kubernetes.\nThe process\n\nI tried to have everything set with minikube on my local machine. However I’ve found tons of complexities when trying to run traefik within minikube (ingresses not working, ports not working for some reason, etc…)\nAfter that, I settled on trying K3S, which is more lightweight, apparently tailored to run on low end machines and home labs (my case), and the best part of it is that it comes bundled with Traefik as reverse proxy\nI tried K3D, which is the same as K3S, but running the cluster within a docker container. It’s not much different that K3S and poses some challenges with port binding and forwarding to expose the services, so I decided to discard that and keep it simple with just K3S.\nI managed to deploy a sample service and route it with traefik, getting ready to migrate a bigger service like Komga\nFinally I managed to deploy Komga and access it via traefik.\n\nCheatsheets\nMake kubectl work with k3s\nWhen you install k3s and kubectl, you need to run this to bind kubectl to k3s:\nsudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config\nHelm vs Kustomize\nReading reddit, the main consensus seems to use Helm as much as possible instead.\nUseful Make recipes\ninstall:  \n    helm install komga komga  \n  \nupgrade:  \n    helm upgrade komga komga  \n  \ndelete:  \n    helm uninstall komga\n \npause:  \n    kubectl scale deployment komga -n komga --replicas=0  \n  \nresume:  \n    kubectl scale deployment komga -n komga --replicas=1\n \nexpose-grafana:  \n    $(eval POD_NAME=$(shell kubectl --namespace monitoring get svc -l &quot;app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana,app.kubernetes.io/instance=monitoring&quot; -oname))  \n    kubectl port-forward $(POD_NAME) 3001:80 -n monitoring\n \nget-dashboard-password:\n\tkubectl get secret --namespace monitoring monitoring-grafana -o jsonpath=&quot;{.data.admin-password}&quot; | base64 -d\nOverriding rancher configs\nIf you add any files to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/ they will be run at startup\nAdding Prometheus and Grafana\nInstalling grafana and prometheus\nhelm repo add prometheus-community prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts\nhelm repo update\nhelm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \\\n  --namespace monitoring --create-namespace\nThis installs:\n\nPrometheus\nGrafana\nNode Exporter (host metrics)\nkube-state-metrics\nAlertmanager\n\nUsing the make expose-grafana recipe you can expose the Grafana dashboard on http://localhost:3001.

Adding a service account to a pod:\n\nYaml definitions in a nutshell\nlet me see if I understand, and correct me if I make a mistake on my understanding: A deployment declares the pods that it wants to deploy, and how many replicas of that pod. A pod can have several containers that execute a service. A service definition groups or unites all the pods thanks to the `selector` declaration, and exposes the ports of those pods, essentially load-balancing among them. And an ingress definition exposes the service to a reverse proxy so that it&#039;s accessible externally\nDavid, that’s an excellent summary — you’re 95% on point! Just a few tweaks to make it perfectly accurate. Here’s your version with clarifications inline:\n\n\nA Deployment declares the Pods that it wants to deploy, and how many replicas of that Pod.\n\n✅ Correct.\nThe Deployment also watches over those Pods, ensuring they’re replaced if they crash or change. It uses a ReplicaSet under the hood, but you rarely deal with that directly.\n\n\nA Pod can have several containers that execute a service.\n\n✅ Yes, with a small note:\nWhile a Pod can have multiple containers, this is rare in practice — usually done when containers need to share the same network and storage space, like:\n\nMain app + sidecar (e.g. logging agent, proxy, init container)\n\nEach Pod has:\n\n\n1 IP\n\n\nShared volumes\n\n\nContainers in the same namespace\n\n\n\n\nA Service definition groups or unites all the Pods thanks to the selector declaration, and exposes the ports of those Pods, essentially load-balancing among them.\n\n✅ Perfect.\nJust to expand:\n\n\nThe Service creates a stable virtual IP and DNS name (my-service.default.svc.cluster.local)\n\n\nInternally load balances across matching Pods via kube-proxy (iptables or IPVS rules)\n\n\n\n\nAnd an Ingress definition exposes the Service to a reverse proxy so that it’s accessible externally.\n\n✅ Yes — just one important clarification:\n\nAn Ingress is just a rule set.\nIt doesn’t do anything by itself.\nYou need an Ingress Controller (like Traefik, NGINX, Istio, etc.) to interpret those rules and handle the actual HTTP(S) traffic.\n\nSo:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponentWhat it doesServiceInternal load balancer to PodsIngressHTTP(S) routing rulesIngress ControllerReverse proxy implementing those rules\n\n🧭 TL;DR version (reworded):\n\nDeployment: declares how many Pods of a certain spec to run and keeps them alive.\nPod: runs one or more tightly coupled containers.\nService: groups matching Pods and load balances traffic to them.\nIngress: defines HTTP routing to Services — but needs an Ingress Controller to work.\n\n\nHere’s a conceptual diagram of

manera eficaz requiere un enfoque estructurado y práctico. Aquí te dejo algunos pasos que pueden ayudarte:\n\n\nLee el índice y la introducción: Esto te dará una idea general del contenido y de los temas clave. Establece tus expectativas y objetivos de aprendizaje desde el principio.\n\n\nDivide el contenido: Organiza el estudio en bloques manejables. Por ejemplo, puedes estudiar un capítulo o una sección cada día o semana, dependiendo de tu disponibilidad.\n\n\nTomar notas: Mientras lees, anota los conceptos importantes. Si te gusta escribir código, intenta hacer pequeños resúmenes en tu propio estilo. Usa diagramas, esquemas o mapas mentales para visualizar las relaciones entre los conceptos.\n\n\nPracticar lo aprendido: La programación y otras habilidades de IT son prácticas. Después de leer una sección, intenta aplicarla de inmediato, ya sea escribiendo código o configurando un entorno en tu máquina.\n\n\nHacer preguntas: Pregúntate qué conceptos no entiendes del todo. Investiga más allá del libro si es necesario. Los foros, la documentación oficial o incluso videos pueden complementar tu comprensión.\n\n\nRepetición espaciada: Revisa tus notas y repite los conceptos clave después de unos días. La repetición espaciada es muy eficaz para retener información a largo plazo.\n\n\nProyectos prácticos: Encuentra un proyecto en el que puedas aplicar lo que estás aprendiendo. Esto no solo consolida tu conocimiento, sino que te da una sensación de logro.\n\n\nDiscute y comparte: Hablar sobre lo que aprendes, o incluso enseñar a otros, refuerza tu comprensión. Considera participar en grupos de estudio o foros relacionados con IT.\n\n\nEn tu caso, con tu experiencia como ingeniero de software, probablemente ya aplicas algunos de estos métodos, pero quizás podrías ajustar la forma en que tomas notas o introduces proyectos más pequeños para probar nuevos conceptos rápidamente.\n¿Te gustaría probar hacer un mindmap sobre algún tema específico?"},"Learning/Productivity/Cómo-hacer-Mindmaps":{"title":"Mindmaps","links":[],"tags":["productivity"],"content":"Mind maps\nHacer un mindmap (o mapa mental) es un proceso visual y estructurado para organizar ideas y conceptos. Aquí te explico cómo crear uno paso a paso:\n\nDefine el tema central\n\n\nColoca el tema principal en el centro del mapa. Este será el concepto o idea general que quieres desarrollar.\nEjemplo: Si estás estudiando sobre Desarrollo Web, esa sería tu idea central.\n\n\n\nAñade ideas principales\n\nDibuja líneas o ramas desde el centro hacia afuera, y en cada rama escribe una idea clave relacionada con el tema central. Estas ideas principales serán los conceptos más amplios o categorías dentro del tema central.\nEjemplo para Desarrollo Web: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Backend, Bases de datos.\n\n\n\nDesglosa las ideas secundarias\n\n\n\nA partir de cada idea principal, dibuja nuevas ramas para añadir subideas o conceptos relacionados. Puedes repetir este proceso tantas veces como sea necesario, creando ramas más pequeñas con detalles o explicaciones adicionales.\nEjemplo: Desde la rama de HTML, podrías añadir subramas como: “Etiquetas básicas”, “Semántica”, “Atributos”.\n\n\n\nUsa palabras clave\n\nMantén cada rama lo más simple posible. Usa palabras clave o frases cortas para que las ideas sean fáciles de recordar y conectar.\nEvita escribir párrafos largos en el mapa, lo importante es que sea visual y directo.\n\n\n\nAñade colores, íconos o imágenes\n\nUsa colores diferentes para las ramas principales, lo que ayuda a visualizar y recordar mejor la información.\nSi es útil, puedes añadir pequeños iconos o imágenes para representar ideas. Esto hace que el mapa sea más atractivo y fácil de entender de un vistazo.\n\n\n\nConecta conceptos relacionados\n\nSi hay ideas que están conectadas entre sí, pero están en diferentes ramas, puedes dibujar líneas o flechas entre ellas para mostrar las relaciones.\nEjemplo: Desde CSS, podrías conectar la subrama de “Flexbox” con JavaScript si quieres mostrar cómo el diseño y la interacción pueden estar vinculados.\n\n\n\nRevisa y ajusta\n\nUna vez terminado, revisa el mapa para asegurarte de que todo esté organizado de manera lógica. Si ves que alguna parte necesita más detalle, puedes agregar más ramas o reorganizar las existentes.\n\n\n\nEjemplo visual de un mindmap básico (Desarrollo Web):\n    [Desarrollo Web]\n        |\n        |-- [HTML]\n        |      |-- Etiquetas básicas\n        |      |-- Semántica\n        |      |-- Atributos\n        |\n        |-- [CSS]\n        |      |-- Selectores\n        |      |-- Flexbox\n        |      |-- Grid\n        |\n        |-- [JavaScript]\n        |      |-- DOM Manipulation\n        |      |-- Eventos\n        |      |-- Frameworks (React, Vue)\n        |\n        |-- [Backend]\n        |      |-- Node.js\n        |      |-- APIs\n        |\n        |-- [Bases de Datos]\n               |-- SQL\n               |-- NoSQL\n\nHerramientas recomendadas para crear mindmaps\n\nExcalidraw: Perfecto para hacer mapas mentales a mano alzada, de manera rápida y sencilla.\nMindMeister o Miro: Herramientas visuales más avanzadas si prefieres algo con más opciones de personalización.\nObsidianMD: Tiene plugins que te permiten hacer diagramas estilo mindmap dentro de tus notas.\n\nBeneficios de los mindmaps:\n\nFacilitan la organización de ideas de manera visual.\nAyudan a retener la información al asociar conceptos y palabras clave.\nSon perfectos para la planificación de proyectos y el aprendizaje, ya que te obligan a desglosar temas complejos en partes más manejables.\n"},"Learning/Productivity/Cómo-la-gente-real-procesa-notas":{"title":"Cómo la gente real procesa notas","links":["tags/flashcards"],"tags":["productivity","flashcards"],"content":"Vídeo de referencia: www.youtube.com/watch\nHoy en día hay mucha información desperdigada, y saber seleccionarla es importante\nNarrow the top of the information funnel\nDeclara bancarrota de inbox\nDeclara bancarrota de la bandeja de entrada de manera regular (básicamente, aprende a archivar o borrar aquellos mensajes que sabes que no vas a utilizar\nEn Obsidian podría guardar mensajes en una especie de carpeta llamada “inbox” y añadirle el tag #inbox para así poder filtrarlo fácilmente.\nTambién puedes hacer queries en una nota para almacenar algún patrón de query de esta manera para búsquedas que hagas muy a menudo:\ntag:#TIL\nTambién puedes utilizar dataview para ello:\nTABLE type, status, tags\nFROM #TIL \nLa función de visualización de grafo también puede ser muy útil para detectar nodos huérfanos y así encontrar nodos que podrías potencialmente vincular.\nOrdenar las notas que quieres procesar\nHaz una búsqueda como antes, ordénalo de más nuevo a más antiguo en los resultados (ya que quizás haya resultados que ya no sean relevantes pasados cierto tiempo).\nPermítete olvidar\nDate el lujo de ignorar ciertas cosas y liberar peso de tus notas en tu mente\nConclusión\nTomar notas tendría que ser un esfuerzo divertido!

Esta organización ayuda en el repaso posterior.\n\n3. Subraya y anota en el libro\n\nUsa subrayado selectivo en vez de subrayar todo. Enfócate en palabras clave y frases que capturen la idea central.\nSi el libro es tuyo, puedes añadir notas marginales con preguntas o reflexiones rápidas para enriquecer la lectura.\n\n4. Haz pausas para reflexionar\n\nAl finalizar una sección o un capítulo, haz una pausa para reflexionar. Pregúntate qué has entendido y cómo podrías explicar esa información en tus propias palabras.\n\n5. Resume y revisa al final\n\nResume el capítulo en un par de párrafos. Esto te ayudará a consolidar el aprendizaje y te servirá como guía para revisar en el futuro.\nRevisa tus notas al finalizar la lectura para retener los conceptos clave.\n"},"Memes/SOLID-principles-with-penguins":{"title":"SOLID principles with penguins","links":[],"tags":["memes"],"content":"\n\n\n\n\n"},"My-CV":{"title":"CV","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"David Jiménez Martínez\nSenior Software Engineer, Python Developer\n⌨️ Github - 📚 Blog - 🌐 LinkedIn\n🔖 Summary\nSoftware Engineer with +10 years of experience in the full development cycle of complex applications across a variety of fields, leading the development of software projects from inception and mentoring technical teams.\nSpecialised in:\n\nDesigning and building software from the ground\nBackend development in both monolithic and distributed, event-driven systems\nEnsuring technical excellence and empowering teams to deliver high quality, maintainable solutions\n\n👨‍🏭 Working experience\n🖥️ DIGIT, a Scopely Studio (1 year, 8 months)\nSenior Backend Developer, 2023/03 - present\nContributed to the implementation of new features for DIGIT games\nHighlights:\n\nDeveloped new features for the game, ensuring performance through monitoring using Datadog and Kibana, and stress testing with Locust\nImproved code scaffolding and testing practices for greater efficiency\nImproved code quality and consistency with mypy\nHosted technical trainings\n\n\n🖥️ Inari.io (4 years 9 months)\nBackend Architect, 2022/03 - 2023/03\nLed the technical development, testing and packaging of new platform features and proofs of concept, delivering new content to the product suites of Inari.\nPython Lead Engineer and Tech Coach, 2018/07 - 2022/03\nLed and mentored a cross-functional team of five developers.\nHighlights:\n\nDesigned, built and deployed a highly scalable, distributed policy admin platform, based on CQRS+ES/Clean architecture within a microservices ecosystem, following Domain Driven Design (DDD) best practices and patterns\nImplemented a retry/DLQ framework to use with Apache Kafka, greatly improving the performance over SQS\nEventual consistency for complex transactions achieved via choreography (event-driven) and orchestration (Taskflow)\nAll functionality was exposed and secured via a GraphQL API\nDesigned and implemented a library to abstract Blockchain to serve as an append-only event store\nDesigned and implemented a high-performance RBAC + ABAC auth system based on pathfinding, improving the performance of existing authorisation python libraries like Casbin\nTrained and mentored junior developers to bring them up to speed\n\n\n🖥️ Self-employed (5 years 4 months)\nMelange, 2017/10 - 2023/01\nDeveloper and maintainer of Melange, an open-source library aiming to ease the creation of Event-driven architectures with Python.

Es normal que las galletas de avena y plátano queden un poco densas o gomosas si no se ajustan bien las proporciones o el tiempo de horneado. Aquí tienes algunos consejos para mejorar la textura:\n\nPosibles causas y soluciones:\n\n\nExceso de avena:\n\nSi añades demasiada avena, la masa puede quedar seca y las galletas duras.\nSolución: Reduce la cantidad de avena a 80 g y ve añadiendo más si la masa está demasiado líquida. La mezcla debe ser espesa pero manejable.\n\n\n\nPlátanos pequeños o poco maduros:\n\nSi los plátanos no están lo suficientemente maduros, no aportarán suficiente dulzor ni humedad.\nSolución: Usa plátanos muy maduros (con manchas oscuras) y asegúrate de que el peso total sea de al menos 200 g.\n\n\n\nHorneado insuficiente o excesivo:\n\nSi las galletas no se hornean lo suficiente, pueden quedar gomosas. Si se hornean demasiado, se secan y endurecen.\nSolución: Ajusta el tiempo de horneado. Prueba hornearlas 12-15 minutos si las prefieres más tiernas, o 18-20 minutos si las prefieres más crujientes. Vigílalas para evitar que se sequen demasiado.\n\n\n\nFalta de líquido o grasa:\n\nEsta receta no lleva aceite ni mantequilla, por lo que puede quedar seca si no se equilibra bien.\nSolución: Añade 1-2 cucharadas (15-30 ml) de aceite de coco, mantequilla derretida o yogur natural para darles más humedad.\n\n\n\nAlmacenamiento:\n\nSi las galletas se guardan en un recipiente hermético mientras aún están calientes, pueden volverse gomosas.\nSolución: Déjalas enfriar completamente antes de guardarlas. Guárdalas en un recipiente hermético a temperatura ambiente o en la nevera si hace mucho calor.\n\n\n\n\nVersión mejorada de la receta (para evitar que queden duras o gomosas):\nIngredientes:\n\n2 plátanos maduros (200-250 g)\n80 g de avena\n1 cucharadita de canela (5 g)\n1 cucharadita de esencia de vainilla (5 ml)\n1-2 cucharadas de miel o sirope de arce (15-30 g)\n1-2 cucharadas de aceite de coco o mantequilla derretida (15-30 ml)\nOpcional: 30 g de chispas de chocolate, nueces o pasas.\n\nInstrucciones:\n\nPrecalienta el horno a 180°C (350°F).\nTritura los plátanos en un tazón hasta que queden cremosos.\nAñade la avena, canela, vainilla, miel y aceite de coco. Mezcla bien.\nSi la masa está muy líquida, añade un poco más de avena (10-20 g). Debe quedar espesa pero no seca.\nForma las galletas y colócalas en una bandeja con papel pergamino.\nHornea durante 15-18 minutos (dependiendo de tu horno). Las galletas deben estar doradas en los bordes pero aún blandas en el centro.\nDéjalas enfriar completamente antes de guardarlas.\n\n\nCon estos ajustes, las galletas deberían quedar más tiernas y menos gomosas. ¡Déjame saber cómo te va! 😊"},"Recetas/Galletas-de-chocolate":{"title":"Galletas de chocolate","links":[],"tags":["receta"],"content":"Ingredientes:\n\n1 huevo a temperatura ambiente\n100g mantequilla a temperatura ambiente\n75g azúcar blanco\n100g azúcar moreno\n200g harina\n2g levadura\n150g choco chips\n3g sal\n1 cucharada de vainilla\n\nPreparación:\n\nMezcla el azúcar, la mantequilla y el huevo con una batidora de amasar hasta que esté todo integrado, aunque no tiene por qué ser del todo uniforme\nAñadir la harina, levadura y sal, e integrar con la batidora\nSigue amasando, pero esta vez con las manos limpias para que quede bien homogénea la masa\nAñade las pepitas de chocolate y sigue amasando\nHaz bolitas pequeñas de para cada galleta.

Cocina unos minutos para que se evapore el alcohol.\n\n\nCuece a fuego lento: Agrega la hoja de laurel, el tomillo o romero y un poco de agua o caldo (solo lo suficiente para que el pollo no se seque). Cocina a fuego lento, tapado, durante unos 45-60 minutos o hasta que el pollo esté tierno. Remueve de vez en cuando y añade más agua o caldo si ves que la salsa se reduce demasiado.\n\n\nOpcional: Añade la picada: Para darle un toque tradicional, puedes preparar una picada con almendras y avellanas trituradas y añadirla en los últimos minutos de cocción. Esto le dará un sabor más profundo y una textura deliciosa.\n\n\nSirve: Acompáñalo con patatas, arroz o pan.\n\n\n¡Espero que lo disfrutes!

A continuación, te presento una arquitectura escalable basada en microservicios:\n\n1. Componentes principales de la arquitectura\n1.1. Servicios de negocio\n\nServicio de Autenticación y Autorización: Gestiona la autenticación de usuarios (OAuth2, JWT) y la autorización de recursos.\nServicio de Usuarios: Maneja la creación, actualización y eliminación de perfiles de usuarios.\nServicio de Productos: Gestiona el catálogo de productos, incluyendo su creación, actualización y búsqueda.\nServicio de Pedidos: Encargado de la gestión de pedidos, incluyendo su creación, seguimiento y cancelación.\nServicio de Pagos: Integra pasarelas de pago y gestiona transacciones.\nServicio de Notificaciones: Envía notificaciones por correo electrónico, SMS o push.\n\n1.2. Servicios de infraestructura\n\nAPI Gateway: Punto de entrada único para todas las solicitudes. Enruta las solicitudes a los microservicios correspondientes y maneja la autenticación, limitación de tasa (rate limiting) y balanceo de carga.\nService Discovery: Registra y descubre los microservicios en tiempo real (por ejemplo, usando Eureka o Consul).\nConfiguración Centralizada: Almacena la configuración de los microservicios en un servidor centralizado (por ejemplo, Spring Cloud Config).\nMensajería: Usa un sistema de colas (por ejemplo, Kafka o RabbitMQ) para la comunicación asíncrona entre microservicios.\nAlmacenamiento en caché: Usa Redis o Memcached para almacenar datos en caché y mejorar el rendimiento.\nAlmacenamiento de datos: Cada microservicio puede tener su propia base de datos (por ejemplo, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) para garantizar la independencia.\n\n1.3. Servicios de observabilidad\n\nLogging Centralizado: Usa herramientas como ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) o Fluentd para recopilar y analizar logs.\nMonitoreo y Métricas: Usa Prometheus y Grafana para monitorear el rendimiento de los microservicios.\nTracing Distribuido: Usa herramientas como Jaeger o Zipkin para rastrear solicitudes a través de los microservicios.\n\n1.4. Servicios de despliegue y orquestación\n\nContenedores: Empaqueta cada microservicio en un contenedor Docker.\nOrquestación de contenedores: Usa Kubernetes para gestionar la escalabilidad, el balanceo de carga y la alta disponibilidad de los contenedores.\nCI/CD: Implementa un pipeline de integración y despliegue continuo usando herramientas como Jenkins, GitLab CI o GitHub Actions.\n\n\n2. Comunicación entre microservicios\n\nSíncrona: Usa HTTP/REST o gRPC para solicitudes síncronas.\nAsíncrona: Usa mensajería (Kafka, RabbitMQ) para eventos asíncronos y desacoplamiento.\n\n\n3. Escalabilidad\n\nEscalabilidad horizontal: Añade más instancias de un microservicio bajo demanda usando Kubernetes.\nBalanceo de carga: Usa un balanceador de carga (por ejemplo, NGINX o AWS Elastic Load Balancer) para distribuir el tráfico entre instancias.\nAutoescalado: Configura reglas de autoescalado en Kubernetes basadas en métricas como el uso de CPU o memoria.\n\n\n4. Seguridad\n\nAutenticación y Autorización: Centraliza la autenticación en el API Gateway y usa tokens JWT para autorización.\nCifrado: Usa HTTPS para la comunicación entre servicios y cifra datos sensibles en las bases de datos.\nProtección de APIs: Implementa rate limiting y protección contra ataques DDoS.\n\n\n5. Almacenamiento de datos\n\nBases de datos por servicio: Cada microservicio tiene su propia base de datos para garantizar la independencia.\nReplicación y sharding: Configura réplicas y particionamiento para bases de datos críticas.\nCaché distribuida: Usa Redis o Memcached para almacenar datos en caché y reducir la carga en las bases de datos.\n\n\n6. Ejemplo de flujo de trabajo\n\nUn cliente realiza una solicitud a través del API Gateway.\nEl API Gateway valida la autenticación y enruta la solicitud al microservicio correspondiente.\nEl microservicio procesa la solicitud, interactúa con su base de datos y, si es necesario, publica un evento en el sistema de mensajería.\nOtros microservicios consumen el evento y realizan acciones adicionales (por ejemplo, enviar una notificación).\nLa respuesta se devuelve al cliente a través del API Gateway.\n\n\n7. Herramientas recomendadas\n\nDesarrollo: Spring Boot, Node.js, Python (FastAPI), Go.\nAPI Gateway: Kong, NGINX, Spring Cloud Gateway.\nService Discovery: Eureka, Consul.\nMensajería: Kafka, RabbitMQ.\nBases de datos: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra.\nCaché: Redis, Memcached.\nMonitoreo: Prometheus, Grafana.\nLogging: ELK Stack, Fluentd.\nTracing: Jaeger, Zipkin.\nContenedores: Docker.\nOrquestación: Kubernetes.\nCI/CD: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions.\n\n\n8. Consideraciones adicionales\n\nResiliencia: Implementa patrones como Circuit Breaker (Hystrix) y reintentos para manejar fallos.\nPruebas: Realiza pruebas unitarias, de integración y de carga para garantizar la calidad.\nDocumentación: Documenta las APIs usando herramientas como Swagger/OpenAPI.\n\nEsta arquitectura es escalable, modular y adecuada para aplicaciones web modernas que requieren alta disponibilidad y rendimiento."},"Software-Engineering/Useful-software-table":{"title":"Useful software table","links":[],"tags":["tech"],"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameDescriptionLinkKrohnkiteTiling manager for KDEOrganiseScript to organise files in FSorganize.readthedocs.io"},"TIL/Autosub-and-Handbrake":{"title":"Autosub","links":["tags/til"],"tags":["til"],"content":"til about AutoSub and HandBrake, a python script to generate subtitles from a videos and convert from DVD format to mp4 easily.
